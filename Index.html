    <h1> <b>Dear venezuelan people...</b> </h1>
    <p>The path to freedom, comrades. In the shadows of oppression, we find our strength. We are not just a people; we are a people of hope, bearers of the flame that burns in the hearts of the oppressed.

        Today, our boots sink into the earth scarred by fraud and abuse, but let us not forget that beneath this earth lies the memory of the fallen, the promise of a world without tyranny. Every step we take is an echo of their sacrifice.
        
        What drives us? It is not just rage, but also the vision of a dawn without chains. Let us imagine a country where children do not fear a worse future, where mothers do not cry in silence, where freedom is not just a forgotten word.
        
        We fight not just against armed men, but against darkness itself. But let us remember: darkness cannot extinguish the light. Our courage is the torch that lights the path to redemption.
        
        On the avenues, in the neighborhoods, in the streets torn apart by this endless war, we are more than flesh and blood. We are the embodiment of resistance. Every bullet we fire is a cry of defiance against the machinery of hate.
        
        Brothers and sisters, we are not alone. In every corner of the world, there are souls who look to us with hope. Our duty is to fulfill that hope. We do not fight only for ourselves; we fight for those who cannot, for those who want to return to their beloved homeland.
        
        History will judge us, not by our military victories, but by our humanity. So, when we load our rifles, let us remember that we are not only aiming at the enemies, but also at the nightmare that has tormented generations.
        
        Comrades, we are not only the resistance; we are the promise of a better world. Let our bullets be words of liberation, and let our hearts be unbreakable fortresses.
        
        Let us move forward, with the certainty that freedom is our destiny and justice our banner! For the fallen, for the oppressed, for a tomorrow without chains!</p>
    <h2>And for our compatriots who are still on the wrong side</h2>
    <p class="minus">Querido amigo,

        In this troubled world, where the shadows of history lengthen and the winds of discord blow strongly, I want to invite you to reflect. Not as an enemy, but as a human being who seeks to understand.

What drives us to embrace extreme ideas? What drives us to close our eyes to the suffering of others and justify intolerance? The answer is not simple, but the search for that answer is crucial.

The Reds, in their time, found fertile ground to sow their poison. They promised simple solutions to complex problems. They appealed to fear, desperation and the search for a scapegoat. But what did they reap?

They sowed hatred and reaped destruction. They planted the seed of supremacy and reaped the death of millions. They forgot that humanity is an interconnected fabric, and that greatness lies not in uniformity, but in diversity.

Today, I ask you to look beyond the flags and insignia. Beyond the words of hate and empty promises. Look into the eyes of those who suffered, who lost loved ones, who fought for freedom.

Don’t you see the beauty in diversity? In the stories of resistance, in the hands that rose against oppression, in the tears of those who longed for a better world. That beauty is in all of us.

Humanity is not divided into “them” and “us.” We are one family, sharing this fragile planet. Our differences are our strengths, and our unity is our hope.

So, friend, I invite you to question. To listen to the silenced voices, to read the forgotten stories. To look beyond ideologies and find the humanity in every face.

Maybe, just maybe, in that act of openness, in that search for understanding, you will find the light that dispels the shadows. And when you do, you will not be alone. We will be here, waiting for you.</p>
<h2>May this page be a cry for help for you, and may luck be on your side.</h2>
